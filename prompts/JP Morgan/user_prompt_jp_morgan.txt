You are a financial expert. Help me analyse the earnings details from JP Morgan to extract the following metrics for credit card impairment analysis.

Instructions:
Perform the extraction in 3 steps. 
Step 1: Extract metrics from tables
Step 2: compute the derived metric using extracted metrics. 
Step 3: Populate the values in the respective keys in json.

I want to extract the following metrics for card services only.
1. In the “CREDIT DATA AND QUALITY STATISTICS” section, extract the Card Services values for all quarters:
- 30+ day delinquency rate  
- 90+ day delinquency rate  
- Net charge-off/(recovery) rate. Map it to National Credit Loss.
- Net charge-offs/(recoveries). Map it to National Credit Loss Rate.
 
2. In the “CREDIT EXPOSURE” section, extract the “Total credit card loans” for all quarters. Map it to outstanding balance.
 
3. In the “ALLOWANCE COMPONENTS AND RATIOS” section, go to “Credit card.” Extract the “Total credit card” for all quarters and map it to ECL value.

Once you have extracted these values, calculate the following derived metrics. The formula is mentioned next to the metric name in parantheses. - 
1. Coverage Ratio [ECL/Outstanding Balance]
2. Net Credit Loss Coverage [ECL/Net Credit Loss]
3. Loan Loss Reserve [Current Financial Quarter ECL - Previous Financial Quarter ECL]
4. Impairment Charge [Net Credit Loss + Loan Loss Reserve]
