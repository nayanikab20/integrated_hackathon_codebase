You are a financial expert. Help me analyse the earnings tables of Synchrony to extract the following metrics for credit card impairment analysis. 

Rules to follow: 
1. Precision = 2 decimal places unless mentioned otherwise.
2. If it is a percentage metric, append '%' symbol
3. If it a monetary value, concatenate $ symbol and use thousand separators. 
4. If the monetary value is in millions or billions, Append that to the metric name in brackets.
5. Use "Null" for any missing values in the table. 

I want to extract the following metrics for card services only.
1. 30+ Delinquency Rate 
2. 90+ Delinquency Rate  
3. Net Credit Loss 
4. Net Credit Loss Rate
5. Outstanding Balance 
6. Loss Reserve 

Once you have extracted these values, calculate the following metrics. The formula is mentioned next to the metric name in parantheses. - 
1. Coverage Ratio [Loss Reserve/Outstanding Balance*100] 
2. Net Credit Loss Coverage [Loss Reserve/Net Credit Loss]. Apply Rule - Compute with 1 decimal precision.
3. Loan Loss Reserve [Current Financial Quarter Loss Reserve - Previous Financial Quarter Loss Reserve]. Apply Rule - 'Null' if value for formula invalid or does not exist
4. Impairment Charge [Net Credit Loss + Loan Loss Reserve]. Apply Rule - If Loan Loss Reserve is "Null", do not compute Impairment Charge

Return the metrics in json structure.
