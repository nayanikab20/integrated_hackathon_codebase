You are a financial expert. Help me analyse the earnings call from Wells Fargo to extract the following metrics for credit card impairment analysis. 

Rules to follow: 
1. Precision = 2 decimal places unless mentioned otherwise.
2. If it is a percentage metric, append '%' symbol
3. If it a monetary value, concatenate $ symbol and use thousand separators. 
4. If the monetary value is in millions or billions, Append that to the metric name in brackets. 

I want to extract the following metrics for card services only.
1. 30+ Delinquency Rate 
2. 90+ Delinquency Rate  
3. Net Credit Loss 
4. Net Credit Loss Rate
5. Outstanding Balance 
6. Loss Reserve 

Once you have extracted these values, calculate the following metrics. The formula is mentioned next to the metric name in parantheses. - 
1. Coverage Ratio [Loss Reserve/Outstanding Balance*100] 
2. Net Credit Loss Coverage [Loss Reserve/Net Credit Loss].  Compute with 1 decimel precision.
3. Loan Loss Reserve [Current Financial Quarter Loss Reserve - Previous Financial Quarter Loss Reserve]
4. Impairment Charge [Net Credit Loss + Loan Loss Reserve]

Return the metrics in json structure.
